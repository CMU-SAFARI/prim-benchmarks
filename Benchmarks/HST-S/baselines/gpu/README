Histogram - input partition (HST)

Compilation instructions:

    make

Execution instructions

    ./hsti -n 1006632960 -g 512

For more options:

    ./hsti -h


Note:
The input folder contains one image from Van Hateren's natural image database 
(http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/?id=227). Image pixels are 12-bit depth. Thus, 
for calculation of the B-bin histogram of an image, the corresponding histogram 
bin is computed as ((pixel * B) >> 12).
Monochrome images from other databases or synthetic images can also be used. The 
read input function (in main.cpp) might need to be changed accordingly. If image 
pixels are b-bit depth and the histogram contains B bins, the histogram bin will 
be computed as ((pixel * B) >> b).
